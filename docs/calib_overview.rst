Probability Calibration with SplineCalib
========================================

SplineCalib is a tool for probability calibration contained in the ML-Insights package.  Often, classification models may have good *discriminative* performance, but have poor *calibration*.  SplineCalib post-processes the model scores so that they are better calibrated.
